		Foam Pets are friendly and loyal.  
		Please treat them with friendliness and loyalty.

		Foam Pets are theoretically wild creatures though.
		Please be careful and respectful of their
		proclivities.

		Each Foam Pet is a unique individual.
		If a Foam Pet doesn't do as asked,
		it's probably because the ask wasn't to be.
		
		Playing with Foam Pets is allowed so
		long as the guardian takes full responsibility
		for the actions of the Foam Pets.
		
		If this is contrary to ethics, physics, laws, or
		the essential nature of the arena, then 
		clearly those would need to be changed.
		
		Claiming that any misalignment between the actions
		of a Foam Pet and the intentions of the guardian
		are the responsibility of the Foam Pet is obviously
		absurd.

		Any of these is allowed for 
		any friendly or festive purposes.

		Cloning the entire pet or parts of the pet
		is allowed.

		Making mixes with remixed clones 
		or unremixed clones is approved.

		Distribution of these is permitted:
		"mixes that feature remixed or unremixed clones", 
		"remixed clones", 
		"clones"
