		This is a description of how the rules
		are built... for building purposes.


		Asks:
			Perhaps:
				[ ] vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules/Laboratory_PyPI
					vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules/Laboratory_Sveltnetics
					
		Structure:	
			Git Repository:
				./__Novel/__rules
			
			Sveltnetics:
				./vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules
				
				./vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules

			
			PyPI:
				vehicles/foam_pet/readme.md
				vehicles/foam_pet/Rules			
					
				Originals:
					vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules/Adoption_Location
				
				PyPI structures:
					vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules/Laboratory

					
					The frontend processes send rules to here,
					then the entire rules folder is cloned and
					added to:
						
						vehicles_frontend/sveltnetics/static/Rules
				
				
			CX_Freeze:	
				./__Novel/Publishing/CX_Freeze/Rules.E.HTML
					
			Docker:
				./vehicles_actual_docker/building/Foam_Pet.Rules.E.HTML
